 - I only mentioned projects that are "presentable" projects, meaning I have proof of (on GitHub). I have done more but this is fine for now. Gonna add more in the future :D.

## What I will do in the future?
- I have to finish my personal website T.T after the exams. Not entirely pleased with how I went with the design, so I am going to remake it.
- After my exams, I intend to focus on web development, particularly .NET and React, while exploring cloud infrastructure (Azure, AWS). May consider learning Node.js as well for backend.
- I want to try out different system designs & distributed systems in my future projects as practice.
- I want to learn more NoSQL like Redis.
- However, I am open to focus on different fields like IoT... My first intern will turn my focus and I am willing to go all in and focus on whats required.
